## APP Details

This is a PWA with Api cacheing and offline native feel to explore this functionality. Firstly open developer console using `F12` goto the `application` tab and choose the offline option select that then the page will prompt `Offline mode`.

Also the Api is cached and used for performance it will not make additional API calls for one hour cache time.
